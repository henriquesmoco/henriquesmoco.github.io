Welcome! I am one of those geeks that loves IT (well, I have a tech blog hosted on GitHub so this cat should be out of the bag by now ;)

This blog was created as a central place for information, preferably quick and to the point information, so I don't have to hunt or waste time trying to remember something I did or saw long time ago...

Hopefully some of those things will be of help for others as well.
